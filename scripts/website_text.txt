College Football Players in Transfer Portal for 2022-23
A lot of FBS players will be changing teams this offseason.
STEVEN LASSANAUG 27, 2023
College football's transfer portal for the 2022-23 season opens on Dec. 5 for players to officially enter and explore their options for the upcoming year. The first window closes on Jan. 18, with the second transfer availability coming April 15-30 in the spring. 

A significant round of player movement from every team at the FBS level is expected over the last few weeks. To keep up with all of the moves, Athlon Sports will update its player tracker throughout the offseason. This comprehensive list includes players transferring from FBS programs, as well as players from FCS (or lower divisions) garnering interest from the FBS level. 


Note: This list was compiled through media reports and social media accounts from players. Also, this list will be updated daily to account for new portal entries.
