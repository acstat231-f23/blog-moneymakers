## What is N.I.L.?

The ability to profit from one's own Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL), became legal for college athletes on July 1, 2021. The rule change allows college athletes to monetize their own status and influence.

## What is Our Objective?

The rule change allowing players to monetize their NIL has greatly influenced college sports, namely football. College Football has long been a money-making machine for institutions across America. However, as the schools, athletics departments, and coaches reaped the benefits of their football teams' successes, it was illegal for players to make profits. This all changed in July of 2021 with the legalization of NIL. The world of NIL has since led to massive controversy. Arguably the largest issue that has stemmed is the concern that people are no longer loyal to their team. The transfer portal represents an opportunity for teams to effectively bid for players. This effective bidding war includes money poured into it from school sponsors and fans. The focus in college football has seemingly shifted from an effort to develop one's own players to an attempt to "buy" players from rival teams. But how important is NIL to team success? To what degree does NIL influence player transfer decisions?

As a group, we question what common factors may induce players that transfer, and whether the post-NIL world has led to more success for those teams who spend more NIL money (measured by winning percentage before and after NIL legalization). 


    
## Where Did We Collect Our Data?

1. [NIL Data](https://www.on3.com/nil/rankings/player/college/football/)

2. [Win Percentage Data]("https://www.teamrankings.com/ncf/trends/win_trends/?range=yearly_2023&group=0")

3. [Transfer Portal Data]("https://www.on3.com/transfer-portal/industry/football/2023/")

4. [School Conferences]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NCAA_Division_I_FBS_football_programs")


```{r include=FALSE}
# Read all data:
athlete_data <- read.csv("data/athlete_nil_data.csv")
combined_data <- read.csv("data/combined_nil_data.csv")
map_data <- read.csv("data/nil_map_data.csv")
nil_transfer_data <- read.csv("data/athlete_transfer_nil_data.csv")
predictor_data <- read.csv("data/predictor_data.csv")


# Gets all unique colleges and positions into a list:
college_choices <- as.list(unique(athlete_data$College))
position_choices <- as.list(unique(athlete_data$Position))
last_team_choices <<- as.list(map_data$Last.Team)
new_team_choices <<- as.list(map_data$New.Team)
conference_choices <- as.list(unique(predictor_data$NewConf))

# Converts variable names into display names:
axis_choices <- as.list(c("total_nil_valuation", "avg_valuation"))
axis_labels <- as.list(c("Total NIL Valuation ($)",
                         "Average NIL Valuation ($)"))
names(axis_choices) <- axis_labels

# Options for Raido Buttons

```

# Visuals


## Table: Athletes

```{r, fig.cap="Interactive Table Example", out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("res/interactive_table.png")
```

This table display allows the user to be introduced to the data in an easily-digestible way. The user can sort the table by team and/or position while viewing as little or as many players as they would like.

## Scatterplot: Followers vs. Valuation

```{r, fig.cap="Interactive Scatterplot Example", out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("res/followers_valuation.png")
```

NIL Valuation is based on a player's marketability. Whether it be because the player is a top national talent or has a likeable personality to go along with their skillset, they need to be able to garner attention. In today's age, a player's social media following is a tell-tale sign of how well-liked/well-known they are. 

This scatterplot looks at team NIL valuation (the amount of money the school has spent on NIL deals for their players) versus the total followers among the players on NIL deals.

## Scatterplot: Valuation vs. Win/Loss

```{r, fig.cap="Interactive Scatterplot Example", out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("res/valuation_wl.png")
```

NIL valuation is an off-the-field measure that is taken with the ultimate goal of bringing the best possible players on to one's team. However, to understand if that measure has actually worked, we can look at the change in Win/Loss percentage for teams, before and after NIL legislation.

## Map: Follow The Money

```{r, fig.cap="Leafly Network Science / Mapping Example", out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("res/follow_the_money.png")
```

This network map shows what schools transfers have left from and where they have gone to. Also, the user can change the maximum and minimum average NIL values that moved from one given team to another to be more specific in their searches and see various trends in the flow of money. 

## Map: Will My Athlete Transfer?

```{r, fig.cap="Logistic Regression Predictor", out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("res/transfer_prediction.png")
```

Lastly, we have a "Will my Athlete Transfer?" calculator. It uses various predictors, allows the user to change them, and produces a percentage value for the probability an athlete would transfer with those attributes. The probability calculation is based on data of past transfers with similar attributes.


## Links 

You can include [links](https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/) using Markdown syntax as shown. 

You should include links to relevant sites as you write. You should additionally include a list of references as the end of your blog with full citations (and relevant links).


# Interactive Display


```{r}
#| label: ds-salaries-app
#| out.width: "100%"

knitr::include_app("https://tbarach26.shinyapps.io/MoneyMakers/",
                   height = "900px")
```


# Conclusions

Due to NIL being such a new topic, our group didn't possess any pre-existing knowledge about the trends we might encounter. Therefore making informed hypothesis was difficult, because information on the topic is sparse. 

Looking at the results, we can see that 


# Customizing your blog design


As a *final* detail **only** if you have time, you can explore options for customizing the style of your blog. By default, we are using the `cosmo` theme from Bootswatch themes (see Line 7 of this file if you want to switch out themes). 


## Theme

There are 25 Bootswatch themes included with Quarto. You can change the theme easily by specifying one of these themes on Line 7: 

- default  
- cerulean  
- cosmo  
- cyborg  
- darkly  
- flatly  
- journal  
- litera  
- lumen  
- lux  
- materia  
- minty  
- morph  
- pulse  
- quartz  
- sandstone  
- simplex  
- sketchy  
- slate  
- solar  
- spacelab  
- superhero  
- united  
- vapor  
- yeti  
- zephyr

There are, I'm sure, many more similar packages with built in themes, or you can look into how to include a CSS code chunk to customize aspects of a theme.
