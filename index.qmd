## What is N.I.L.?
N.I.L., or Name, Image, and Likeness, was legalized on July 1, 2021. It allows college athletes to monetize themselves using their status and influence.

## What is Our Objective?
NIL has changed college sports, with Football being impacted the greatest. College Football has long been a money-making machine for institutions across America. However, as the schools, athletics departments, and coaches reaped the benefits of their football teams' successes, it was illegal for players to make profits. This all changed in July of 2021 with the legalization of NIL. The world of NIL has since led to massive controversy. Arguably the largest issue that has stemmed is the lack of loyalty to one's team. The transfer portal, and the money-making possibilities that come with transferring schools, has become an intriguing possibility for players. The portal has turned into a bidding war, with money being poured into it from school sponsors and fanbases. College Football has changed from trying to develop one's own players to trying to "buy" another player from a rival team. As a group, we questioned what factors are common for players that transfer, and whether the post-NIL world has led to more success for those teams who spend more NIL money (measured by winning percentage before and after NIL legalization). 

    
## Where Did We Collect Our Data?

1. [NIL Data](https://www.on3.com/nil/rankings/player/college/football/)

2. [Win Percentage Data]("https://www.teamrankings.com/ncf/trends/win_trends/?range=yearly_2023&group=0")

3. [Transfer Portal Data]("https://www.on3.com/transfer-portal/industry/football/2023/")

4. [School Conferences]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NCAA_Division_I_FBS_football_programs")


```{r include=FALSE}
# Read all data:
athlete_data <- read.csv("data/athlete_nil_data.csv")
combined_data <- read.csv("data/combined_nil_data.csv")
map_data <- read.csv("data/nil_map_data.csv")
nil_transfer_data <- read.csv("data/athlete_transfer_nil_data.csv")
predictor_data <- read.csv("data/predictor_data.csv")


# Gets all unique colleges and positions into a list:
college_choices <- as.list(unique(athlete_data$College))
position_choices <- as.list(unique(athlete_data$Position))
last_team_choices <<- as.list(map_data$Last.Team)
new_team_choices <<- as.list(map_data$New.Team)
conference_choices <- as.list(unique(predictor_data$NewConf))

# Converts variable names into display names:
axis_choices <- as.list(c("total_nil_valuation", "avg_valuation"))
axis_labels <- as.list(c("Total NIL Valuation ($)",
                         "Average NIL Valuation ($)"))
names(axis_choices) <- axis_labels

# Options for Raido Buttons
on_off <- as.list(c("Select All", "Deselect All"))


predictor_model <- glm(binomialRep ~ NIL.Valuation + Followers + Rating + Position + NewConf, data = predictor_data, family = binomial)
```

# Visuals/Interactive Displays


## Table: Athletes

```{r, fig.cap="Interactive Table Example", out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("res/interactive_table.png")
```

This table display allows the user to be introduced to the data in an easily-digestible way. The user can sort the table by team and/or position while viewing as little or as many players as they would like.

## Scatterplot: Followers vs. Valuation

```{r, fig.cap="Interactive Scatterplot Example", out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("res/followers_valuation.png")
```

NIL Valuation is based on a player's marketability. Whether it be because the player is a top national talent or has a likeable personality to go along with their skillset, they need to be able to garner attention. In today's age, a player's social media following is a tell-tale sign of how well-liked/well-known they are. 

This scatterplot looks at team NIL valuation (the amount of money the school has spent on NIL deals for their players) versus the total followers among the players on NIL deals.

## Scatterplot: Valuation vs. Win/Loss

```{r, fig.cap="Interactive Scatterplot Example", out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("res/valuation_wl.png")
```

NIL valuation is an off-the-field measure that is taken with the ultimate goal of bringing the best possible players on to one's team. However, to understand if that measure has actually worked, we can look at the change in Win/Loss percentage for teams, before and after NIL legislation.

## Map: Follow The Money

```{r, fig.cap="Leafly Network Science / Mapping Example", out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("res/follow_the_money.png")
```

This network map shows what schools transfers have left from and where they have gone to. Also, the user can change the maximum and minimum average NIL values that moved from one given team to another to be more specific in their searches and see various trends in the flow of money. 

## Map: Will My Athlete Transfer?

```{r, fig.cap="Logistic Regression Predictor", out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("res/transfer_prediction.png")
```

Lastly, we have a "Will my Athlete Transfer?" calculator. It uses various predictors, allows the user to change them, and produces a percentage value for the probability an athlete would transfer with those attributes. The probability calculation is based on data of past transfers with similar attributes.


## Links 

You can include [links](https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/) using Markdown syntax as shown. 

You should include links to relevant sites as you write. You should additionally include a list of references as the end of your blog with full citations (and relevant links).


## Visualizations 

Visualizations, particularly interactive ones, will be well-received. That said, do not overuse visualizations. You may be better off with one complicated but well-crafted visualization as opposed to many quick-and-dirty plots. Any plots should be well-thought-out, properly labeled, informative, and visually appealing.

If you want to include dynamic visualizations or tables, you should explore your options from packages that are built from [**htmlwidgets**](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/showcase_leaflet.html). These **htmlwidgets**-based packages offer ways to build lighterweight, dynamic visualizations or tables that don't require an R server to run! A more complete list of packages is available on the linked website, but a short list includes:

* [**plotly**](https://plot.ly/r/): Interactive graphics with D3
* [**leaflet**](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/): Interactive maps with OpenStreetMap
* [**dygraphs**](http://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs): Interactive time series visualization
* [**visNetwork**](http://dataknowledge.github.io/visNetwork): Network graph visualization vis.js
* [**sparkline**](https://github.com/htmlwidgets/sparkline): Small inline charts
* [**threejs**](https://github.com/bwlewis/rthreejs): Interactive 3D graphics
    
You may embed a published Shiny app in your blog if useful, but be aware that there is a limited window size for embedded objects, which tends to makes the user experience of the app worse relative to a dedicated Shiny app page. Additionally, Shiny apps will go idle after a few minutes and have to be reloaded by the user, which may also affect the user experience. 

Any Shiny apps embedded in your blog should be accompanied by the link to the published Shiny app (I did this using a figure caption in the code chunk below, but you don't have to incorporate the link in this way).

```{r}
#| label: ds-salaries-app
#| out.width: "100%"

knitr::include_app("https://tbarach26.shinyapps.io/MoneyMakers/",
                   height = "900px")
```


# Conclusions

Due to NIL being such a new topic, 


# Customizing your blog design


As a *final* detail **only** if you have time, you can explore options for customizing the style of your blog. By default, we are using the `cosmo` theme from Bootswatch themes (see Line 7 of this file if you want to switch out themes). 


## Theme

There are 25 Bootswatch themes included with Quarto. You can change the theme easily by specifying one of these themes on Line 7: 

- default  
- cerulean  
- cosmo  
- cyborg  
- darkly  
- flatly  
- journal  
- litera  
- lumen  
- lux  
- materia  
- minty  
- morph  
- pulse  
- quartz  
- sandstone  
- simplex  
- sketchy  
- slate  
- solar  
- spacelab  
- superhero  
- united  
- vapor  
- yeti  
- zephyr

There are, I'm sure, many more similar packages with built in themes, or you can look into how to include a CSS code chunk to customize aspects of a theme.
